# üêç Leetcode Solutions in Python (Last Updated in Feb. 2020)

## üìñ Description
Hello everyone! **"LeetCode in Python"** is a **[YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pypLtNT8aNY&list=PLTJ_bWjv6i7xuOoib_cLLEbkH0EeweLej)** where I explain all solutions to *popular* LeetCode problems. Each video contains a **theoretical section** (where I explain the reasoning behind the most optimal solution) and a **practical section** (where I go over the Python solution). Solving these LeetCode problems has helped me land interviews and job offers from numerous tech companies. Stay tuned to learn how to crack (nearly) any coding interview!

**TL;DR: LeetCode in Python will be the one resource you need to get into FAANG; system design not included!**

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è What's in this repo?

This repo contains the **coded solutions** (and any **supplementary material**) to my **["LeetCode in Python" YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pypLtNT8aNY&list=PLTJ_bWjv6i7xuOoib_cLLEbkH0EeweLej)**. Check it out if you tryna dive deep into the realm of computer science. Some aspects of this repo may be elusive unless you watch the corresponding video - keep that in mind as you traverse through these solutions.
